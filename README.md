# Zulu Assault
I'm working on recreating this old awesome game by Dallas Nutsch that I used to play a lot back in the days.
The game was originally published in July 1998 for Windows 95/98/NT platforms supporting DirectX 5.0, which is really outdated. I am using Java with the libraries "LWJGL" and "Slick2D" to develop this game for newer operating systems.
## Instructions

Taken from the old game's HELPME.TXT.
